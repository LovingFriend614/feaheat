InputFile.txt has the following format:

	[1]  Mesh size (N x N):

	[2]  Size of sample in x direction:

	[3]  Size of sample in y direction:

	[4]  Material thickness:

	[5]  Thermal conductivity along x (material defects excluded):

	[6]  Thermal conductivity along y (material defects excluded):

	[7]  Supplied temperature:

	[8]  Read temperatures at opposite end (Amount needed is N + 1):*

	[9]  Number of defective elements (if none type zero and skip [10], [11], and [12]):

	[10] Element numbers (see Ele.png for element numbering):* **

	[11] New thermal conductivities along x (for selected elements in step [10]):* **

	[12] New thermal conductivities along y (for selected elements in step [10]):* **



*  These items are made from multiple numbers which should be listed one per line.
	Item 1
	Item 2
	Item 3
	.
	.
	.

** Order of elements does not matter as long as their order in the lists matches up with themselves.
	CORRECT:
	Element 1
	Element 5
	Element 3
	Thermal along x for element 1
	Thermal along x for element 5
	Thermal along x for element 3
	Thermal along y for element 1
	Thermal along y for element 5
	Thermal along y for element 3

	INCORRECT:
	Element 1
	Element 5
	Element 3
	Thermal along x for element 5
	Thermal along x for element 1
	Thermal along x for element 3
	Thermal along y for element 1
	Thermal along y for element 3
	Thermal along y for element 3


Output file will generate a matrix of size ((N + 1) x (N + 1)) for all nodal temperatures.

No file extension for output file is needed, it will automatically generate a .csv file.


To compile (from within feaheat subfolder):

	javac HeatTransfer.java BoundaryFlux.java BoundaryMatrix.java LUDecomp.java StiffnessMatrix.java


To run (while inside the main feaheat folder and outside of feaheat subfolder):

	java feaheat.HeatTransfer
