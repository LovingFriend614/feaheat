InputFile.txt has the following format:

Mesh size (N x N):

Size of sample in x direction:

Size of sample in y direction:

Material thickness:

Thermal conductivity along x:

Thermal conductivity along y:

Supplied temperature:

Read temperatures at opposite end (Amount needed is N + 1):

Output file will generate a matrix of size ((N + 1) x (N + 1)) for all nodal temperatures

No file extension for output file is needed, it will automatically generate a .csv file

To compile (from within feaheat subfolder):

javac HeatTransfer.java BoundaryFlux.java BoundaryMatrix.java LUDecomp.java StiffnessMatrix.java

To run (while inside the main feaheat folder and outside of feaheat subfolder):

java feaheat.HeatTransfer
